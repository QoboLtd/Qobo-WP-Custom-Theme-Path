Qobo-WP-Custom-Theme-Path
=========================

WordPress plugin that allows one to set a custom theme path.

The plugin currently adds an additional path to where WordPress is looking for themes.  The path is hardcoded (for now) to a custom-themes/ folder, one level above your WordPress installation. This is useful for those setups where you have WordPress installed into a folder (say, using composer).
